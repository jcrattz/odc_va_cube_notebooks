    "# Remote Sensing of Riparian Buffer Ecological Effects\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Riparian Buffer Systems refer to vegetation growing along rivers which fulfill an important ecological role:  they filter non-point source pollution such as fertilizer containing farm runoff and help prevent undesirable ecological effects downstream.  Such effects include algal blooms and creation of dead zones in oceans and lakes, adversely effecting animal and human life as well as local economies which depend on fishing and tourism.  This notebook demonstrates how to perform GIS-based analyses using Open Data Cube to investigate such systems.  Specifically, this notebook presents several methods of integrating non-GIS and GIS data (laboratory based chemical analyses of water, as well as GIS based sensing of vegetation and Total Suspended Matter) by using the Elizabeth River in Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay as an example.  This notebook also presents and demonstrates an algorithm for identifying riparian zones and calculating NDVI indexes for them. \n",

    "## [Introduction &#9652;](#Index)\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explore novel methods for remotely evaluating riparian buffer zones and assessing their ecological effects on water quality. The hope is to use the capabilities of the Open Data Cube platform in combination with water quality data to quantitatively examine links between environmental pollution, riparian vegetation, and water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. This notebook will also serve as a technological demonstration fusing data from both GIS and non-GIS data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Background &#9652;](#Index)\n",
    "The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and is the defining feature of the Virginia coast. As such, the health of its ecosystems is of concern to all Virginians. This notebook also focuses on the Bay and watershed as a case study because of its locality, history of restoration projects, and water quality monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### History\n",
    "In the late 1970s and early 1980s, under the leadership of Sen. Charles Mathias, Congress initiated studies into the rapid loss of both aquatic and wildlife in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. These studies drew attention to the bays declining water quality and identified three areas of immediate concern:\n",
    "- toxic pollutant levels\n",
    "- the decline of bay grasses \n",
    "- nutrient over enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings led to support for the adoption of The Chesapeake Bay Agreement of 1983 which established the Chesapeake Executive Counsel which formed the Chesapeake Bay Program Executive Council. Two further agreements, The 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement and Chesapeake 2000, were later signed adding more partners, setting quantitative goals for the Bay ecosystem, and setting out guides for restoration efforts. Part of these efforts have focused on restoring riparian buffer zones to control non-point sources of pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Riparian Buffer Zones\n",
    "Riparian buffers are areas of vegetation composed of grasses, shrubs, or forest in transition zones between land and water. Buffers are important for slowing runoff and enhancing water infiltration. By slowing runoff and trapping sediment, buffers minimize the opportunities for pollutants to contaminate surface or groundwater. Riparian buffers are conceptualized in three zones each with distinct functions.\n",
    "![Buffer zones](imgs/buffer_zones.png)(Cunningham, Stuhlinger, and Liechty, n.d.) [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "These zones are important in both agrarian and suburban settings, the core being the riparian forrest zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Examples](imgs/buffer_examples.png)(Cunningham, Stuhlinger, and Liechty, n.d.) [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Riparian Buffer zones serve three primary functions in improving water quality:\n",
    "1. Converting Surface flow to Subsurface flow\n",
    "2. Absorbing Nitrogen and Phosphorous Nutrients\n",
    "3. Retaining Sediment\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hydrogeomorphic Regions](imgs/hydrogeomorphic_regions.png)(Lowrance et al. 1997) [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The immediate Chesapeake Bay Area consists primarily of two hydrogeomorphic zones: the Inner Coastal Plain on the western shore and Poorly Drained Upland on the Delmarva Peninsula. \n",

    "## Dissolved Oxygen and Phosphates\n",
    "\n",
    "Dissolved oxygen is a measure of the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water and available to aquatic life. Dissolved oxygen is inversely correlated with water temperature since as water warms it cannot physically hold as much oxygen. We have observed that dissolved oxygen is also inversely correlated with phosphate levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phosphate (PO4) , similar to fixed nitrogen, is a critical nutrient for life as it is necessary for the transport of energy, formation of DNA, and the creation of cellular membranes. However, too much phosphate can disrupt aquatic ecosystems: Phosphate is normally considered the limiting factor for algal growth. An influx of phosphate can trigger a bloom in already nutrient-rich water.\n",
    "\n",
    "One hypothesis is that these two values are inversely correlated due to the activity of algae. Discharged nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous, can stimulate an algal bloom. When the algae comprising the blooms die off, there is then a depletion of oxygen as they are degraded by bacteria, causing the formation of a dead zone. When oxygen concentrations drop below 8 mg/L the water is considered hypoxic and part of a dead zone.   Organisms which require oxygen (such as fish and other animals) may die if unable to escape to more oxygen-rich areas.  This phenomenon is known as [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication).\n",
